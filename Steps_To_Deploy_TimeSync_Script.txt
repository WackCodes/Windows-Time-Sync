/*
Proceed after installing "WindowsTimeSync.bat" file
1) Open Task Scheduler
2) Click on the "Task Scheduler Library" tree on the left side
3) Click "Create Task" on the right side
4) Set a respective name for the task and possibly a description
5) Go to the "Triggers" tab and set the task to begin on Login
	(Ive tried "On Startup", but I dont believe batch files can run before reaching the desktop)
6) In the "Actions" tab, make sure "action" is set to "Start a program"
	Select "Browse", and select the "WindowsTimeSync.bat" file.  
7) In the "Conditions" tab, I recommend turning off "Start the Task only if the computer is on AC power", to be sure the command runs with no extra issues, especially if you use a laptop. 
8) Ignore the settings tab unless desired

That should conclude the required steps for this code to run after logging in
